# 📚 Book Recommender System

A machine learning-based book recommender system built using collaborative filtering. This web application helps users discover new books based on user ratings and similarities using a pre-trained recommendation model.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📈 Recommends books based on user preferences using collaborative filtering.
* 🔥 Displays popular books based on average ratings and number of votes.
* 🧠 Uses a similarity matrix and user-book pivot table for recommendations.
* 🖼️ Shows book title, author, and cover image.
* 🌐 Deployed via Flask with a simple HTML frontend.

## 🧾 Dataset

This project uses the [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes:

* **Books.csv** – Metadata about books.
* **Users.csv** – User details.
* **Ratings.csv** – User ratings for books.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. The **collaborative filtering model** uses user-item interaction matrix (`pt.pkl`) and computes **cosine similarity** between users/books.
2. A query book is selected, and the top similar books are retrieved using `similarity_scores.pkl`.
3. Additional metadata is fetched from `books.pkl` to display book details.
4. Popular books are loaded from `popular.pkl`.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Allow user login & save personal recommendations.
* Integrate content-based filtering for cold-start problem.
* Add filter by genre, author, or publication year.
